# The tests exercise what this plugin OWNS: its exact-phrase command and
# the params it carries. The "hello <apps>" capture is deliberately not
# unit-tested — it matches against the apps collection, which the system
# plugin provides in a running BranchKit; verify it live with
# `branchkit-cli dev say "hello safari" --simulate`.
#
# They run under branchkit-test-harness, which ships inside the BranchKit
# app (or set BRANCHKIT_TEST_HARNESS to a copy). Without it they are skipped,
# not failed; set BRANCHKIT_REQUIRE_HARNESS=1 (in CI, say) to make a missing
# harness a failure instead.
