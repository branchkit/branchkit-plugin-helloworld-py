# Helloworld

A BranchKit plugin

## Setup

The SDK is vendored into the plugin directory — there is no install-time pip
on users' machines:

```bash
python3 -m pip install --target . branchkit
branchkit-cli runtime install python    # once per machine: the managed CPython
```

## Test

```bash
branchkit-cli dev test .
```

## Install

```bash
branchkit-cli plugin install .
```

## Files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `plugin.json` | Manifest — declares actions, keybinds, voice commands, the python runtime |
| `commands.json` | Voice command patterns that trigger actions |
| `main.py` | Handler logic — your plugin's behavior |

## Platform documentation

The full platform docs ship with the app as markdown. Grep them rather than
guessing — they are the reference for the manifest, the RPC surface, matching,
collections, and the event bus.

```bash
branchkit-cli docs sync          # once, after installing or updating BranchKit
grep -rl "requires_tags" "$(branchkit-cli docs path)"
```

## When it does not work

The running app answers questions no document can, because the answer depends
on what else is installed and what state the machine is in.

```bash
branchkit-cli dev smoke                    # side-effect-free health sweep
branchkit-cli dev plog helloworld --since 60s   # what this plugin logged
branchkit-cli dev chain                    # recent command chains, then: dev chain <tr_id>
```
